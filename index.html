                <p><strong>Here is a timeline of Fela Kuti's life:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1938</span> - Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti was born in Abeokuta, Nigeria on 15<sup>th</sup> of October.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1958</span> - Fela was sent to London, UK to study Medicine, but decided to study Music instead at Trinity College of Music. He also formed a band named "Koola Lobitos", playing a fusion of jazz and highlife.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1960</span> - Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola).</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1963</span> - Fela moved back to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1967</span> -  Fela went to Ghana to think up a new musical direction. That was when Kuti first called his music Afrobeat a combination of highlife, funk, jazz, salsa, calypso and traditional Nigerian Yoruba music.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1969</span> - Fela took the band to the United States where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles.While there, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Sandra Izsadore), a partisan of the Black Panther Party. The experience would heavily influence his music and political views.He renamed the band "Nigeria '70". Soon afterwards, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Fela and his band were in the US without work permits. The band performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as The '69 Los Angeles Sessions.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1971</span> - Fela changed his name to Anikulapo (meaning "He who carries death in his pouch", with the interpretation: "I will be the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time for death to take me"). He stopped using the hyphenated surname "Ransome" because it was a slave name. After Fela and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed "The Afrika '70", as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues. He formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home for the many people connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. Fela also set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, first named the Afro-Spot and later, "The Afrikan Shrine".</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1972</span> - Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious with Fela appearing alongside Bobby Tench.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1977</span> - Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash hit and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic, during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune. The Kalakuta Republic was burned, and Fela's studio, instruments, and master tapes were destroyed.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1978</span> - Fela married 27 women, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers. The marriage served not only to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic but also to protect Fela and his wives from false claims from authorities that Fela was kidnapping the women.  The year was also marked by two notorious concerts, the first in Accra in which riots broke out during the song "Zombie", which led to Fela being banned from entering Ghana. The second was at the Berlin Jazz Festival after which most of Fela's musicians deserted him, due to rumours that Fela was planning to use the entire proceeds to fund his presidential campaign. He formed his own political party, which he called Movement of the People (MOP), in order to "clean up society like a mop".</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1979</span> - Fela put himself forward for President in Nigeria's first elections for more than a decade, but his candidature was refused. At this time, Fela created a new band called Egypt '80 reflecting the idea that Egyptian civilization, knowledge, philosophy, mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed as such.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1984</span> - Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling which Amnesty International and others denounced as politically motivated. Amnesty designated him a prisoner of conscience, and his case was also taken up by other human rights groups. After 20 months, he was released from prison by General Ibrahim Babangida. On his release he divorced his 12 remaining wives, saying that "marriage brings jealousy and selfishness". Once again, Fela continued to release albums with Egypt '80, made a number of successful tours of the United States and Europe and also continued to be politically active. </li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1986</span> - Fela performed in Giants Stadium in New Jersey as part of the Amnesty International a Conspiracy of Hope concert, sharing the bill with Bono, Carlos Santana, and the Neville Brothers.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1989</span> - Fela and Egypt '80 released the anti-apartheid Beasts of No Nation that depicts on its cover U.S. President Ronald Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and South African State President Pieter Willem Botha; the title of the composition, as Barrett noted, evolved out of a statement by Botha: "This uprising [against the apartheid system] will bring out the beast in us.".</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1990</span> - Fela's musical output slowed, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1993</span> - He and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle against military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of Sani Abacha. Rumours were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment.</li><br><br>
                    <li><span>1997</span> - 3<sup>rd</sup> of August, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, announced his younger brother's death a day earlier from complications related to AIDS. However, there has been no definitive proof that Kuti died from complications related to HIV/AIDS, and much skepticism surrounds this alleged cause of death and the sources that have popularized this claim. More than one million people attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound. The New Afrika Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the supervision of his son Femi. His youngest son Seun leads Fela's former band Egypt '80.</li>
